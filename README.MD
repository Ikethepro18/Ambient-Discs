# Welcome to Ambient Discs
Ambient Discs is a simple mod that takes the vanilla Minecraft soundtrack and adds music discs for all that don't. This way, you can listen to any piece of the Minecraft soundtrack at any time you please.

## How do I Get the Discs?
For the most part, all discs will be obtained the "good old fashioned way" via skeletons killing creepers. However, there is room in the future for discs to be found in vanilla, or potentially custom, structures to add more merit to exploration.

## Will this Mod have Composer's Tracks?
No, only tracks included in the vanilla game will get a disc. This is mainly for licensing reasons, but also because then it'd end up with hundreds of music discs which is frankly too many.

## Can I Use This for...?
Yes you can use this mod in your modpack, or tweak and remix it in your own way if you'd like. Do bear in mind though it is licensed under [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), so take that into consideration if you do plan on using it
